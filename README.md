# What makes you tick? ðŸ•‘

In this challenge, you will be using your newfound knowledge of asynchronous code to control time and make the hand of this clock tick. Break down the problem, make a plan, and then translate it into code.

## Requirements

- You should use setInterval.
- The hand should move around the clock every second and should complete a full revolution in 60 seconds.
- You should adjust the rotation of the hand using the transform property as demonstrated in `main.js`.

## Bonus after your clock is ticking

- Use the JS Date object to get the real seconds.
- Add a minute hand.
- Add an hour hand.
